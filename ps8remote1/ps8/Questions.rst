Norm
----

* What is your code for `mpi_norm`? (Cut and paste the code here.)

* Per our discussions in lectures past about weak vs strong scaling, do
  the plots look like what you would expect? Describe any (significant)
  differences (if any).

* For strong scaling, at what problem size (and what number of nodes) does
  parallelization stop being useful?  Explain.


Grid
----

* What is your code for halo exchange in `jacobi`?  (Cut and paste the code here.)
  If you used a different scheme for extra credit in `mult`, show that as well.


* What is your code for `mpi_dot`?  (Cut and paste the code here.)
